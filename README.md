# Simple release planning

A project to simplify release planning based on constraint solving.

This library consists of an interface to a release plan model, a constraint solving model, and a toolkit for conflict and diagnosis handling. A release plan interface is used to implement your model based on releases, requirements and constraints.
The model interface is then solved using a constraint solving approach based on choco library. <link>
It can be used in two ways. The first usecase is to check for model consistency. Second, it can be used to generate or complete release plans.

## Getting Started

Add this library as maven dependecy or download the sources.


### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo


## Built With

* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) - Dependency Management
* [Choco](http://www.choco-solver.org/) - An Open-Source java library for constraint programming
